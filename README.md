<h1>MS Edge Extension Tryout</h1>
<p>As I want to spice things up a bit with my Edge browser, I got interested with
the idea of making my own extensions. This is the first step on making one of my
dreams possible, i.e. I made a simple popup extension which shows a static image.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
In order to use the extension, it must be sideloaded:
<ol>
    <li>Open the <code>edge://extensions</code> page by choosing the three dots
    at the top of your browser and then selecting Extensions.</li>
    <li>On the extension management page at <code>edge://extensions</code>, turn
    on Developer mode using the toggle at the bottom left of the page.</li>
    <li>When installing your extension for the first time, choose Load Unpacked.
    You'll be prompted for the directory with your extension source files. Your
    extension is installed in your browser, similar to extensions installed from
    the store.</li>
</ol>
